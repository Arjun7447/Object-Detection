# Vision-Based Object Recognition and Prosthetic Hand Project

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains the source code and documentation for a cutting-edge project in the field of image recognition and prosthetics. The project focuses on developing a vision-based system that enables a prosthetic hand to recognize and manipulate objects independently.

## Key Features

- **Object Recognition:** The proposed model utilizes advanced image processing and machine learning techniques for object recognition. This enables the system to identify and distinguish between different objects in its environment.

- **Pick and Place Functionality:** The core functionality of the system lies in its ability to pick and place objects. When instructed to select a specific object from a group, the model employs image processing to accurately identify and extract features of the target object.

- **Machine Learning Integration:** The system incorporates machine learning algorithms for robust object recognition. Feature extraction plays a crucial role in training the model to recognize a variety of objects effectively.

- **Prosthetic Hand Development:** The ultimate goal of this research is to create a trans-radial prosthesis, specifically designed for upper limb amputees. The prosthetic hand is engineered to seamlessly recognize objects, grasp them with precision, and relocate them as needed.
